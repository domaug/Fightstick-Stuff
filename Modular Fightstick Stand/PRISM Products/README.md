The PRISM is a diabolical contraption created by the brilliant [WuhnWae](https://www.twitter.com/wuhnwae) and sold by the lovely folks at [GRAM Controllers](https://www.twitter.com/GRAMControllers). 

I love it. It is ergonomic, eye-catching, AND open-source. Because it's open-source, it's not limited to being used for platform fighters. I've made mine based on features made by [Avtom](https://www.github.com/avtom) and Kumite.

Anyway, I want to show off some things I made for all the lucky PRISM owners.

## The PRISM Podium

It's just a round disk to display your PRISM! It's 7" in diameter and is made for support-free 3D printing.

## Modular Fightstick Stand - PRISM Edition

Based on my Modular Fightstick Stand designs, this printable, modular stand was made specifically for the PRISM. Though, it's versatile enough that you can use it for other builds as well.

## Outro

I love the PRISM. Support WuhnWae and support GRAM Controllers. That's all for now.
