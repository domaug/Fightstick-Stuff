# Modular Fightstick Stand

![IMG_20240802_080146](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94dc203c-bcaf-45b0-b88f-538690d63082)

This project is my answer to a question almost nobody asked: what if I want a stand for my arcade controller (aka "fightstick") but it has a unique shape or I have unique needs for displaying it?

The parts in this project are all modular and, when assembled together, function as a stand for your fightsticks.

## Break it down for me.

Good news: it's already broken down!

My goal for this project was to make sturdy stands for fightsticks that are customizable to suit the owner's needs and accommodate many different shapes and sizes of fightsticks. The components are all 3D printable as designed, and one stand assembly will use approximately 110-120g of filament.

This project is for you IF: 

- You want to display your fightsticks slightly upright instead of flat down on a shelf.
- You have access to a 3D printer.
- You like to tinker and play with very basic assembly.

## Fantastic Parts (and how to assemble them)

To make a stand, you would need the following components: 

- (At least 2) "Leg" pieces
- (At least 2) "Endcap" pieces (one "Male"/"Male&Female" and one "Female"/"Male/Female")
- (At least 1) "Spine" piece

Assembly is very simple. The "Leg" pieces have a notch at the bottom where you can slide in an "Endcap" piece. Install your "Endcap" pieces into your "Leg" pieces, then bridge the two "Legs" with a "Spine" piece. 

The parts use dovetail connections to join to each other. The tolerances were designed to hold the pieces together with friction between the layer lines, though your print settings and filament choices may affect the fit. The dovetail connections are universal in all of the components, so you can join any "Male" connection with any "Female" connection and make some creative configurations of stands.

## Print settings

I used default settings for a Bambu Lab A1 printer through Bambu Studio with the following changes: 

- Wall loops: 3
- Infill: 15%
- Sparse infill pattern: Honeycomb
- Support type: Normal (auto)
- Support style: Snug
- Support threshold angle: 15

Supports are only recommended for components with "Female" connectors. For "Spine" and "Endcap" pieces, you can print them on their flat bottom side. For "Leg" pieces, you can print them on either of their side faces. If you have a textured PEI plate, you can print the "Legs" on different faces so you can use the textured side on the outside of the stand.

## Closing

Thank you for checking out this project. I hope it helps you display your fightsticks safely and effectively. If you have any questions, concerns, or even requests for suggested stand pieces, you can contact me with your feedback. 

I recommend everyone check out the OpenStickCommunity as well. They are making incredible fightstick products and are also responsible for the ever-increasingly popular GP2040-ce breakout board firmware which is changing the way people play their fighting games on modern consoles.
