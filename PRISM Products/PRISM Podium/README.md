## The PRISM Podium

This is just a 3D printable disk that you can use to display your PRISM. :)

It measures 7" in diameter and is meant to be 3D printed topside down so supports are not necessary. I use the following settings to ensure a solid quality print.

- Wall loops: 3
- Infill: 15%
- Infill pattern: Honeycomb OR Concentric

I printed mine on a textured PEI plate to give it a nice rough texture but you can also print on a smooth plate (or if you're feeling super fancy, one of those cool holo effect plates). I also printed mine with Fuzzy Skin for the outer walls and it gave the part a unique textured exterior underneath the plate.

Fiddle around with whatever print settings you want. It's just a 7" diameter disk. :)
