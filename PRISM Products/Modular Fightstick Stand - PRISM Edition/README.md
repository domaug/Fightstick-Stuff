## Modular Fightstick Stand - PRISM Edition

Print the files in this folder based on my [Modular Fightstick Stand](https://github.com/domaug/Fightstick-Stuff/tree/main/Modular%20Fightstick%20Stand) guide to have your own PRISM stand!

You will need the following to make your own stand: 
- (2) "stand leg_prism"
- (1) "modular spine_2.5in"
- (1) ["Endcap (Male)"](https://github.com/domaug/Fightstick-Stuff/blob/main/Modular%20Fightstick%20Stand/3D%20Print%20Files/Endcap_Male.STL)
- (1) ["Endcap (Female)"](https://github.com/domaug/Fightstick-Stuff/blob/main/Modular%20Fightstick%20Stand/3D%20Print%20Files/Endcap_Female.STL)

For the "Stand Leg" component, you can print it on either large side without supports. In fact, if you have a textured PEI plate and want a nice exterior finish, I recommend printing one "Stand Leg" each on both sides. The "Endcap" components and "Modular Spine" should be printed with the flat side down and use supports. I used the following print settings for the components:

- Wall loops: 3
- Infill: 15%
- Sparse infill pattern: Honeycomb
- Support type: Normal (auto)
- Support style: Snug
- Support threshold angle: 15

Assembly is simple: just snap the "Endcap" components into the "Stand Leg" components, with the fastener sides facing inward, then join the two assemblies with the "Modular Spine".
